### Description and Objectives Completed

The Request Enhancer Augments an incoming Ad Request. It fetches data from various microservices and injects it into the Ad request

The project has been written in node.js and automated tests have been written using mocha chai.

Objectives Completed:

 - Inject the Site Demographics
 - Inject the Publisher details
 - Inject the Country of Origin
 - Latency is < 500ms
 - automated tests have been provied
 - abort transaction if request originates from ip address outside the US
 - abort the transaction if publisher ID cannot be obtained
 - application is fault-tolerant. incoming request proceeds despite failure of non-required service. 
 - If demographics cannot be obtained due to failure of microservice, we inject "Not Found" for "pct_female"
 - The application was also tested through Postman to run about 50 requests at a 50ms delay between each requests. Application was successfully able to handle all requests.
